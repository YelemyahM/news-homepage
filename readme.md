## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how use the media queries to make a responsive application.

```css

@media  screen  and (max-width: 350px) {
	.container {
		width: 100%;
	}
}

```

### Continued development

There is a bonus in this challenge : toggle the mobile menu. But it require javascript knowledge. I'll update it when I'll be capable to use JS.
